# SBC GPT Notion Integration - Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project aims to improve the Notion integration in SBC GPT by implementing a structured knowledge representation approach and enhancing the search and retrieval capabilities. The goal is to create a more effective system for answering user queries based on content stored in the Notion workspace.

## Objectives

- Implement a hardcoded structure representation of the Notion workspace
- Create a more effective search and retrieval system
- Improve response quality and relevance
- Implement a two-stage retrieval process for better user experience
- Handle different document types appropriately

## Timeline

| Phase | Tasks | Timeline | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Structure Definition & Page Mapping | Week 1 | Not Started |
| 2 | Search & Retrieval Implementation | Week 2 | Not Started |
| 3 | Content Processing & Response Generation | Week 3 | Not Started |
| 4 | Testing & Integration | Week 4 | Not Started |

## Detailed Tasks

### Phase 1: Structure Definition & Page Mapping

#### 1.1 Hardcoded Structure Definition
- Create a JavaScript object defining the main sections of the Notion workspace
- Define document types (POLICY, PROCEDURE, etc.) and their characteristics
- Map known child pages to their parent sections
- Define key terms for each section to help with relevance matching

#### 1.2 Page ID Mapping System
- Create a function to retrieve all page metadata from Notion
- Implement a mapping function to connect Notion page IDs to the structure
- Add fuzzy title matching to handle slight variations in page titles
- Create a fallback classification for unknown pages

**Deliverables:**
- `workspaceStructure.js` - Definition of the workspace structure
- `pageMapper.js` - Functions for mapping Notion pages to the structure
- Documentation of the structure and mapping approach

### Phase 2: Search & Retrieval Implementation

#### 2.1 Structure-Aware Search
- Implement a function to analyze queries and determine relevant sections
- Create a search function that prioritizes relevant sections
- Add document type-specific relevance scoring
- Implement result deduplication and sorting

#### 2.2 Two-Stage Retrieval Process
- Create an initial search function that returns potential answer locations
- Implement a preview generation function for search results
- Add a detailed content retrieval function for when users request more info
- Include structural context in responses

**Deliverables:**
- `structuredSearch.js` - Structure-aware search implementation
- `twoStageRetrieval.js` - Two-stage retrieval process implementation
- Test cases demonstrating the improved search capabilities

### Phase 3: Content Processing & Response Generation

#### 3.1 Content Processing by Document Type
- Implement type-specific content processors (for POLICY, PROCEDURE, etc.)
- Create extractors for steps, requirements, contacts, etc.
- Add formatting functions to present content appropriately based on type
- Implement a default processor for unknown document types

#### 3.2 Query Intent Classification
- Implement basic intent classification (DEFINITION, PROCESS, CONTACT, etc.)
- Create intent-specific search strategies
- Add response formatting based on query intent
- Implement fallback strategies for unclear intents

#### 3.3 Response Generation
- Create a response formatting function that includes source information
- Implement a summarization function for long content
- Add contextual information about the workspace structure
- Create a function to suggest related pages

**Deliverables:**
- `contentProcessors.js` - Document type-specific content processors
- `intentClassifier.js` - Query intent classification implementation
- `responseGenerator.js` - Response generation and formatting functions
- Examples of responses for different query types and document types

### Phase 4: Testing & Integration

#### 4.1 Testing and Validation
- Create test cases for different query types
- Implement validation for the structure mapping
- Add logging for search and retrieval processes
- Create a simple feedback mechanism for responses

#### 4.2 Notion API Integration Improvements
- Enhance error handling for API timeouts and rate limits
- Add retry logic for failed API calls
- Implement a simple caching system for frequently accessed pages
- Create a function to handle block-parented pages properly

#### 4.3 Integration with Main Application
- Connect the Notion agent to the central router
- Implement the agent's canHandle function based on query analysis
- Add the agent's process function using the new retrieval system
- Ensure proper error handling and fallbacks

**Deliverables:**
- `notionApiClient.js` - Improved Notion API client
- `notionAgent.js` - Updated Notion agent implementation
- Test suite for the entire integration
- Documentation for the integration

## Implementation Approach

### MVP Strategy
For the MVP, we'll use a hardcoded approach to represent the structure of the Notion workspace. This allows for faster implementation while still providing the benefits of structured knowledge representation. As the product evolves, we can gradually replace hardcoded elements with more dynamic approaches.

### Key Components

1. **Workspace Structure Definition**
   - Hardcoded representation of the Notion workspace structure
   - Document type definitions and characteristics
   - Section-specific key terms and relevance indicators

2. **Page Mapping System**
   - Connects Notion page IDs to the defined structure
   - Handles unknown pages with simple classification
   - Uses fuzzy matching for title comparison

3. **Structure-Aware Search**
   - Leverages the workspace structure for more effective search
   - Prioritizes relevant sections based on query analysis
   - Handles different document types appropriately

4. **Two-Stage Retrieval**
   - Initial search returns potential answer locations
   - Detailed retrieval only when requested by the user
   - Includes structural context in responses

## Success Criteria

- The system can accurately map Notion pages to the defined structure
- Search results are more relevant and focused on the appropriate sections
- The two-stage retrieval process provides a better user experience
- Different document types are handled appropriately
- Response quality and relevance are improved

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Notion API rate limits | Could slow down or block retrieval | Implement caching and rate limiting |
| Structure changes in Notion | Could break hardcoded mappings | Regular updates to the structure definition |
| Complex queries beyond simple intent classification | Reduced response quality | Implement fallback strategies and continuous improvement |
| Large content volumes affecting performance | Slow response times | Optimize retrieval and processing, implement pagination |

## Next Steps After MVP

1. **Dynamic Structure Discovery**
   - Replace hardcoded structure with dynamic discovery
   - Implement periodic updates to keep the structure current

2. **Semantic Search Enhancement**
   - Add embedding-based search for better semantic matching
   - Implement more sophisticated relevance scoring

3. **Learning from User Feedback**
   - Implement a feedback loop to improve future retrievals
   - Track successful query-result pairs

4. **Advanced Content Processing**
   - Add more sophisticated content extraction and summarization
   - Implement cross-document reference following
